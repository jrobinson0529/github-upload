                At an early age I was exposed to computers in various ways through my father. He was a server technician at a large construction company and was an early PC hobbyist himself. My father imparted good problem solving methodology
                and habits on me early on. I had a home PC where I would spend the majority of my free time playing and modding video games as well as learning about basic coding principles by making a game through a game maker software
                that was easy to digest for the early programmer. I navigated many bugs, issues, and problems in the PC world on my own and learned to not only grasp but enjoy the problem solving aspects.
